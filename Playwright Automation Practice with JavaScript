# Playwright Practice with JavaScript and Typescript

This repository contains my practice projects and tests using **Playwright** with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. Playwright is a powerful browser automation library that supports testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. In this project, I am experimenting with various features of Playwright, writing end-to-end tests, and automating web interactions.
